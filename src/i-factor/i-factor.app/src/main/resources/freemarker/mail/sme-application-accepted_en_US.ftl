    <a href="${base}">Service agreement to use the EntroAuction platform </a>
    EF comments: in EntroAuction platform, so far we dun have this function, Seller and Buyer can't download the service agreement from platform. In the final version of process, seller and buyer only can go to the branch to sign the contract, no download function. if Bank/The Bank would like to have this function, it will cause delay and extra cost for this workload. Pls have a review and modify accordingly.
